the Dorian Gray Experiment
==============================
> The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. - Oscar Wilde, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_

You can [watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKYF07Y4kA) a video, or [listen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1slq_FwRN8o) to some music... but you can not interact with it. 

But technology is here to help us once more ! So with this repo I want to work on some experiments about making a user experience when you can listen, watch and interact with the given piece of art (a film or any music you like).

###Let's start !

We will use `three.js` with `webgl`.

The goal is something similar to 
* http://lights.elliegoulding.com/
* http://inear.se/beanstalk/
* http://www.ro.me/ <-- this is one of the best appoaches

Some ideas
----------

* Rank many different threejs animations and random them with the music and the intensivity of the song.
