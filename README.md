interactiveExperimentalProject
==============================

Experimental project about an interactive music experience where you can interact with the video and the music.

Use three.js with webgl

The goal is something similar to 
* http://lights.elliegoulding.com/
* http://inear.se/beanstalk/
* http://www.ro.me/ <-- this is one of the best appoaches

Some ideas
----------

* Rank many different threejs animations and random them with the music and the intensivity of the song.
